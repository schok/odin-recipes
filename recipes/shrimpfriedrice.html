    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a quick and easy shrimp fried rice recipe that my kids all love! This recipe is best warm and fresh, but will keep airtight in the refrigerator for up to 5 days or in the freezer for up to 4 months. Reheat gently, as desired.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons sesame oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
        <li>1 cup frozen peas and carrots</li>
        <li>½ cup frozen corn</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, finely minced, or more to taste</li>
        <li>3 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>4 cups cooked rice</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons thinly sliced green onions</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce, or more to taste</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat sesame oil and olive oil in a large nonstick skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add shrimp and cook until they are bright pink on the outside and the meat is opaque, about 3 minutes, flipping halfway through.</li>
        <li>Remove shrimp from the skillet using a slotted spoon, allowing oils and cooking juices to remain in the skillet. Place shrimp on a plate and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add peas and carrots and corn to the skillet and cook, stirring intermittently, until vegetables begin to soften, about 2 minutes. Add garlic; cook and stir for 1 minute. Push vegetables to the side of the skillet, pour eggs into the other side, and cook to scramble, stirring as necessary, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir shrimp, rice, and green onions into the skillet. Drizzle evenly with soy sauce, season with salt and pepper, and stir to combine. Cook until shrimp is reheated through, about 2 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
